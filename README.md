# Safe Crossing
This project is about determining which crosswalk a pedestrian is about to cross with a mobile phone and optionally hardware devices installed on the intersection. Pedestrians and specially blind people are the target audience for this project.  

## Overview
In this project, we use the Pozyx kit in order to determine the precise location of the user and if the user is close to a traffic light, we send the status of the traffic light to user's smart phone.  

## Structure of the project and repository
This project has three main parts: 
- A backend written in NodeJS. The Backend folder also has a sub folder named Pozyx that contains the necessary code for precise localization.
- A Frontend written in Flutter. 
- ARKit development and experimentation. This part is completely separate from the backend and frontend parts.
Each part has a *README* file that acts like the documentation.
