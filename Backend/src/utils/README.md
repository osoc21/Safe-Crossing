Here we have`call_python_script.js`, this calls our python script that communicates with the <a href="https://pozyx.io/" target="_blank">Pozyx</a> device.

We are able to do this by using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/python-shell" target="_blank">python-shell</a> library.

The `socketio_client.js` file is for testing purposes only.
